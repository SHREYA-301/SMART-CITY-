## Code Implementation

1.Smart Residential Communities
Business Case: Creating efficient residential areas with optimized resource allocation and access to utilities.

Algorithm: Kruskal’s Algorithm

Why Chosen: Kruskal’s algorithm can help design an optimal utility grid (water, electricity, gas) by connecting residential buildings with the least cost. It ensures that residential zones are connected efficiently and that resources are distributed with minimal infrastructure costs.

2.Efficient Waste Management Systems
Business Case: Ensuring waste collection routes are optimized and minimizing the cost of waste disposal.

Algorithm: Dijkstra’s Algorithm

Why Chosen: Dijkstra’s algorithm can be applied to optimize waste collection routes. It helps in finding the shortest paths for waste trucks, ensuring they cover all neighborhoods efficiently while minimizing travel time and fuel costs. This is key to reducing the carbon footprint and making waste management more sustainable.

3.E-Waste Recycling
Business Case: Managing the collection and processing of electronic waste efficiently.

Algorithm: Sorting Algorithm

Why Chosen: A sorting algorithm can be used to categorize and organize e-waste based on type (e.g., mobile phones, computers, batteries), making it easier to recycle or dispose of the components. This ensures that recycling centers can efficiently sort and process the waste to maximize reuse.

4.Green Urban Design
Business Case: Planning and optimizing green spaces, energy-efficient buildings, and sustainable urban infrastructure.

Algorithm: Kruskal’s Algorithm (for optimal design of green spaces)

Why Chosen: Kruskal's algorithm can be applied to connect green spaces, parks, and other ecological zones in a way that minimizes land use and promotes connectivity. This helps in urban planning by ensuring green areas are efficiently distributed throughout the city, enhancing sustainability.
