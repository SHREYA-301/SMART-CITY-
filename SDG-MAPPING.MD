| Smart Residential Communities    | SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities| Target 11.1: Ensure access for all to adequate, safe, and affordable housing. <br> Indicator 11.1.1: Proportion of urban population living in slums, informal settlements, or inadequate housing. |
| Waste Management Systems         | SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production | Target 12.4: Achieve environmentally sound management of chemicals and wastes. <br> Indicator 12.4.2: Hazardous waste generated per capita and proportion treated. |
| E-Waste Recycling                | SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production | Target 12.5: Substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling, and reuse. <br> Indicator 12.5.1: National recycling rate, tons of material recycled. |
| Green Urban Design               | SDG 13: Climate Action                     | Target 13.2: Integrate climate change measures into policies, strategies, and planning. <br> Indicator 13.2.1: Number of countries with climate change mitigation/adaptation strategies. |

## Refining Business Cases based on SDG
- *Smart Residential Communities*: Design smart homes with IoT-enabled devices for optimized energy consumption and eco-friendly living to improve affordability and sustainability.
- *Waste Management Systems*: Introduce an AI-based waste sorting mechanism to reduce landfill contribution by 30%, and implement a waste-to-energy process.
- *E-Waste Recycling*: Deploy blockchain-based decentralized recycling centers across the city to track and manage e-waste recycling processes effectively.
- *Green Urban Design*: Plan parks, green roofs, and urban forests to reduce the city's carbon footprint by 20%, offering natural climate adaptation strategies.
