## Code Implementation

1.Smart Residential Communities
Business Case: Creating efficient residential areas with optimized resource allocation and access to utilities.
Algorithms That Can Be Used:
- *AVL Trees*:  
  - Efficiently manage databases for resident records, such as household details and resource consumption.  

- *HashMaps*:  
  - Store and retrieve residential infrastructure information quickly (e.g., available amenities).  

- *Sorting Algorithms*:  
  - Organize housing projects based on pricing or occupancy.


Algorithm chosen: Kruskal’s Algorithm

Why Chosen: Kruskal’s algorithm can help design an optimal utility grid (water, electricity, gas) by connecting residential buildings with the least cost. It ensures that residential zones are connected efficiently and that resources are distributed with minimal infrastructure costs.


2.Efficient Waste Management Systems
Business Case: Ensuring waste collection routes are optimized and minimizing the cost of waste disposal.
Algorithms That Can Be Used:
- *Graph Algorithms*:  
  - *BFS/DFS*: Plan efficient waste collection routes.  
  - *Kruskal's Algorithm*: Build waste disposal networks with minimal cost.  

- *Heap*:  
  - Prioritize high-waste zones for faster cleanup.  

Algorithm Chosen: Dijkstra’s Algorithm

Why Chosen: Dijkstra’s algorithm can be applied to optimize waste collection routes. It helps in finding the shortest paths for waste trucks, ensuring they cover all neighborhoods efficiently while minimizing travel time and fuel costs. This is key to reducing the carbon footprint and making waste management more sustainable.


3.E-Waste Recycling
Business Case: Managing the collection and processing of electronic waste efficiently.
Algorithms That Can Be Used:
- *Union-Find (Disjoint Sets)*:  
  - Track recyclable materials within connected systems for sorting.  

- *Sorting Algorithms*:  
  - *Heap Sort*: Categorize waste by material type for efficient processing.  

- *HashMaps*:  
  - Store data on recyclable materials and their drop-off points.

Algorithm Chosen: Sorting Algorithm

Why Chosen: A sorting algorithm can be used to categorize and organize e-waste based on type (e.g., mobile phones, computers, batteries), making it easier to recycle or dispose of the components. This ensures that recycling centers can efficiently sort and process the waste to maximize reuse.


4.Green Urban Design
Business Case: Planning and optimizing green spaces, energy-efficient buildings, and sustainable urban infrastructure.
Algorithms That Can Be Used:
- *Graph Algorithms*:  
  - *Floyd-Warshall Algorithm*: Map connections between green spaces and urban areas.  

- *Segment Trees*:  
  - Monitor vegetation health across city zones in real time.  

- *Backtracking Algorithms*:  
  - Plan optimal planting locations to maximize ecological impact.

Algorithm Chosen: Kruskal’s Algorithm (for optimal design of green spaces)

Why Chosen: Kruskal's algorithm can be applied to connect green spaces, parks, and other ecological zones in a way that minimizes land use and promotes connectivity. This helps in urban planning by ensuring green areas are efficiently distributed throughout the city, enhancing sustainability.
