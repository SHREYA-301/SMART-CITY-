### 1. Problems in Nature

The types of problems encountered in nature can be categorized into algorithmic problems based on solution approaches:
- **Iteration**: Repeating tasks (e.g., summing numbers or processing data in loops).
- **Recursion**: Functions calling themselves to solve smaller problems (e.g., Tower of Hanoi, factorials).
- **Backtracking**: Exploring all possible solutions (e.g., solving Sudoku, generating permutations).

---

### 2. Space and Time Efficiency

- **Time Efficiency**: Measures execution time based on input size. Example: Quicksort with average time complexity of `O(n log n)` vs. Bubble Sort (`O(n²)`).
- **Space Efficiency**: Refers to memory usage. Example: Merge sort (uses extra memory) vs. Quicksort (in-place).

Efficient algorithms are crucial for scalable, resource-constrained applications.

### 3. Takeaways from Different Design Principles

- **Divide and Conquer**: Solves problems by dividing them into smaller sub-problems (e.g., Merge Sort).
- **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Avoids redundant computations (e.g., Fibonacci numbers).
- **Greedy Approach**: Makes optimal local decisions for global results (e.g., Huffman coding).

---

### 4. Hierarchical Data and Optimization with Tree Structures

Tree structures are effective for organizing and querying hierarchical data:
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: Efficient for search operations (`O(log n)`).
- **AVL Tree**: Maintains height balance.
- **Heap**: Used in priority queues.
- **Trie**: Optimized for string searches (e.g., autocomplete systems).

---

### 5. Need for Array Query Algorithms

Efficiently handle multiple range queries or updates:
- **Segment Trees**: Range queries with `O(log n)` complexity.
- **Fenwick Trees (BIT)**: Simplify prefix sums.

Applications include financial calculations, leaderboards, and analytics.

### 6. Differentiating Trees and Graphs

- **Trees**: Hierarchical, no cycles, strict parent-child relationships (e.g., file systems).
- **Graphs**: Generalized structures with cycles and multiple connections (e.g., social networks).

---

### 7. Sorting and Searching Algorithms

#### Sorting
- **Bubble Sort**: `O(n²)` complexity.
- **Merge Sort**: `O(n log n)` using divide-and-conquer.
- **Quick Sort**: In-place and `O(n log n)` on average.

#### Searching
- **Linear Search**: `O(n)` for unsorted data.
- **Binary Search**: `O(log n)` for sorted data.

Applications include indexing and e-commerce search systems.

### 8. Importance of Graph Algorithms

- **Spanning Trees**: Prim’s and Kruskal’s for cost minimization.
- **Shortest Path Algorithms**: Dijkstra’s for GPS navigation.

Applications include telecommunications and logistics.

### 9. Different Algorithm Design Techniques

- **Greedy Algorithms**: Local choices for global results (e.g., activity selection).
- **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Efficient solutions for overlapping sub-problems (e.g., knapsack problem).
- **Divide and Conquer**: Recursive problem-solving (e.g., quicksort).
- **Backtracking**: Tries all solutions by undoing incorrect choices (e.g., N-Queens problem).
